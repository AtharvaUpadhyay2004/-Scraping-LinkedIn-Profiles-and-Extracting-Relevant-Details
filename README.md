# -Scraping-LinkedIn-Profiles-and-Extracting-Relevant-Details
 set of scripts that allow you to scrape LinkedIn profiles based on a given name, save the profiles as HTML files, and extract relevant details such as education and experience using Python.
 The project consists of two parts: a JavaScript code snippet to be executed in the browser's developer console and a Python script for parsing the downloaded HTML files. üìùüêç

Here's how it works:
1Ô∏è‚É£ First, the JavaScript code performs a LinkedIn search for the provided name and opens each profile in a new tab. It then saves the profile pages as HTML files. This part requires running the JavaScript code in the browser's developer console.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Next, the Python script comes into play. It reads the saved HTML files, utilizes the power of BeautifulSoup library for HTML parsing, and extracts key details such as education and experience.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The extracted details can be used for various purposes, such as analyzing career paths, identifying common qualifications, or gathering insights for research or recruitment.

It's a powerful combination of JavaScript and Python that enables you to automate the process of scraping LinkedIn profiles and extracting valuable information
